# Speech
This repository contains experiments in voice commanded programming.

## StackSpeak

A simple stack-oriented voice-driven programming language.

### Exercises

1. Starting with stack `[1]` and without using the Push operation,
    generate the stack `[25]`.
2. Starting with stack `[1]` and without using the Push operation,
    generate the stack `[1; 2; 3; 4; 5]`.
3. Starting with stack `[1]` and without using the Push operation,
    generate a piece of the fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
4. Starting with stack `[1]` and without using the Push operation,
    generate a piece of the quadratic sequence 4, 9, 16, 25...
5. Starting with stack `[1..100]` and without using the Push operation,
    generate the sum of all the numbers.
